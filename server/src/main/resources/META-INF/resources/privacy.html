	<h1>Zauberer Privacy Statement</h1>

	<p>The game Zauberer is an online game based on the rules of the
		legendary card game "Wizard". During the game, several technical
		components work together.
	<p>
	<h2>1. Participating components</h2>

	<p>Each participating player has an application on his device that
		displays the game interface. All these applications communicate with a
		central server, which implements the game logic and checks compliance
		with the game rules.</p>

	<h2>2. Exchanged data</h2>

	<p>Data exchange during the game takes place only between the
		player's device and the central server. The communication takes place
		in encrypted form via an HTTPS connection according to the current
		state of the art.</p>

	<h3>a) Data exchange with other players</h3>

	<p>When registering, each player chooses a pseudonym with which he
		will be displayed to the other players. In addition to the pseudonym,
		only a randomly generated identifier is communicated to other
		participants of the game in order to be able to clearly assign the
		player's actions. During a game, all game actions of a player are sent
		to the devices of all other players participating in this game.</p>

	<h3>b) Data exchange with the game server</h3>

	<p>When communicating with the game server, each participant
		exchanges, in addition to his or her player ID and the pseudonym he or
		she has chosen, only data that is essential for communication, such as
		the IP address of his or her device and a password that is also
		randomly generated during registration.</p>

	<h2>3. Stored data</h2>

	<h3>a) Account password</h3>

	<p>The player's password is stored on his device in order to be
		able to log the player in automatically when the game is opened again.
		The password is generated by a cryptographically secure random number
		generator and prevents other players from taking over a player's
		account simply by knowing the player ID of a fellow player.</p>

	<h3>b) E-mail address of the player</h3>

	<p>In order to transfer his account to another device or to be able
		to restore it after resetting the application data, the player can
		link an e-mail address to his account. This makes it possible to
		create a new password for the account. In this case, a random code
		will be sent to the linked e-mail address, which the player can use to
		restore his account.</p>

	<p>Only a hash value of the email address associated with an
		account is stored on the game server, so even if the server is
		compromised, players' email addresses cannot be stolen. If a player
		wants to recover an account using their email address, they must
		re-enter it. Only if the hash value of this entry matches the hash
		value stored on the server is recovery possible. An entered e-mail
		address is thus used exclusively for the one-time sending of a code
		for account linking or recovery.</p>

	<h3>c) Log files</h3>

	<p>While a device is connected to the game server, log files are
		written in order to perform analysis in case of technical problems.
		The log files remain on the game server for a limited period of time
		solely for the purposes of error analysis.</p>
